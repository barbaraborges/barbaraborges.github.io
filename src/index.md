# Bárbara Borges

Hi, I'm a Product Software Engineer with focus on Frontend development. I create performant,  accessible and user-centered products. I’m curious by nature, enjoy learning new technologies, and love understanding the business logic behind what I build. I thrive working in diverse and collaborative teams.
